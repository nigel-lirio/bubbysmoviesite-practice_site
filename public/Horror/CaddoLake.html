    <p><strong>Review:</strong> "Caddo Lake" is a masterful blend of psychological horror and atmospheric tension. The film's use of the eerie, fog-covered lake setting amplifies the sense of isolation and dread. The performances by the lead actors are compelling, effectively conveying the escalating fear and paranoia. The directors skillfully build suspense through minimalistic sound design and haunting visuals, making every shadow and rustle in the woods feel menacing. Overall, "Caddo Lake" is a chilling experience that lingers long after the credits roll, making it a must-watch for horror enthusiasts.</p>
